# Simple Echo API

A minimal Go API built with the Echo framework. This API has a single endpoint at the root path that returns "ok" on GET requests.

## Getting Started

1. Install Go dependencies:
```
go mod download
```

2. Run the server:
```
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080. You can access the API at `http://localhost:8080/`.
