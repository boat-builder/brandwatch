# BrandWatch

Watch how your brand performing in AI Search


# Why

In the age of AI search, the way people discover brands has changed dramatically.
Traditional SEO practices — built around predictable algorithms and clear rankings — no longer apply cleanly. AI-driven search engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), surface results based on opaque decision-making processes that we don’t fully understand. We can’t easily track rankings, and we don’t know exactly how or why brands are surfaced (or ignored).

Brandwatch exists to solve this.
It monitors your brand’s visibility across AI search engines, helps you understand how your brand is perceived, and provides clear, actionable strategies to strengthen your presence in this new search era.

Stay visible. Stay competitive. Stay ahead.
